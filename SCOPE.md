# Project Scope: AI-Powered Automated Ethical Hacking Platform

## Overview
This project aims to build an AI-powered platform that fully automates the ethical hacking (red teaming) process. The AI will be capable of researching, adapting, downloading tools, writing scripts, and executing tasks autonomously, all within a user-defined and ethical scope.

## 1. Phases to Automate
- Reconnaissance (including AI-driven research on targets)
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Lateral Movement
- Reporting
- Tool/script creation and downloading as needed

## 2. Target Types
- Web Applications
- Networks (internal and external)
- Cloud Environments
- IoT Devices
- Any other system, with the ability to research and adapt to new/unknown systems

## 3. Constraints
- Operates strictly within a user-defined scope (provided before execution)
- Only performs actions on authorized targets
- Adheres to ethical and legal standards
- Can only use/download tools/scripts as permitted by the user

## 4. End Goal
- Fully automate the ethical hacking/red teaming process
- AI can research, adapt, download tools, write scripts, and execute tasks autonomously
- Generates comprehensive reports and recommendations
