# AI-Powered Ethical Hacking Automation Tool

This project is an AI-driven, modular, command-line tool designed to automate the entire ethical hacking (red teaming) process. It leverages the power of AI (GPT-4) to research, adapt, download tools, write scripts, and execute tasks autonomously, all within a user-defined and ethical scope.

## Features
- Modular architecture (Recon, Scanning, Exploitation, Reporting, etc.)
- Command-line interface for ease of use and automation
- Integrates with popular security tools and AI APIs
- Strict adherence to user-defined scope and ethical guidelines

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run the CLI tool (`python main.py`)

See `SCOPE.md` for project scope and the architecture diagram for system design.
